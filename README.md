Secure Section Mapping Demonstration
This project showcases how to create and securely map sections of memory using native Windows API calls. The code demonstrates best practices for working with memory sections, loading system libraries, and ensuring integrity checks, which are vital when working in a secure environment. These techniques can be extended to safeguard memory modification and injection operations, critical for applications like system monitoring, debugging, or advanced development tasks.

Features
Dynamic Section Creation: Utilizes NtCreateSection to allocate a secure 2MB section of memory.
Memory Mapping: Maps the created section into the process' virtual address space using NtMapViewOfSection.
Memory Integrity Check: Compares the first 4KB of the original ntdll.dll with the newly mapped section to ensure that the code has not been tampered with.
Secure Modifications: Demonstrates secure modification of the mapped section by zeroing out a memory region.
Resource Cleanup: Closes all handles and unmaps the memory section safely to prevent resource leaks and ensure system stability.
